# Token-Miner
Mine PortKVM tokens.

Why: tokens are like virtual crypto. that you can use on is-a.space. or if the company has partnered with is-a.space, you can use tokens if the discord server has used tokens.

# How to mine
- First, go to releases and download the whatever the latest is. As of 2024, its v5
- Download Python (If you already have python, Skip this step)
- Go to the path of where the py file you downloaded is (Recommanded to move to `C:/tokens - windows` or `/tokens - linux`)
- Open Run and type in cmd, in cmd, do `cd (path)` and then `python v5.py`
- Congrats, you have mined 1 token using your shitty ass computer
   
### Importent Note:
Tokens dont need gpus, or cpus, they just need RAM. the more ram the better and faster
