# Token-Miner
Mine PortKVM tokens.

Why: tokens are like virtual money. that you can use on portkvm or "is-a.vps". or if the company has partnered with is-a.vps or portkvm, you can use tokens if the company has used tokens. also, 50 tokens is = 500$ usd. But its not real money, its virtual money. also they mine like ultra fast. the more ram the better and you can get the ultra or pro version by paying with tokens on is-a.vps discord server

# How to mine
